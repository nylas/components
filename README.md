# Nylas Components

Nylas Components are a suite of UI building blocks that let you build user-facing email, calendar, and contacts functionality in minutes. Use Nylas Components with your Nylas account or by adding standard JSON data.

## Background

Front-end UIs can often be time-consuming to build, even for simple functionality. The Nylas Components are designed to help developers more quickly add communications and scheduling functionality into their app.

The Nylas Components include:

- [Agenda](./components/agenda): Display a day, week, or month view of all events from one or more users or calendars.
- [Contact List](./components/contact-list): Display a list of selectable contacts from a userâ€™s contacts book.
- [Composer](./components/composer): Draft and send emails.

The Components repository is for people who want to modify the code and build it from the source. Visit our [documentation](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/) if you are looking for the easiest way to get started with Nylas Components.

If you want to report a bug, create a feature request, or contribute code, take a look at the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTE.md).

## Install

### Agenda

`npm i @nylas/components-agenda`

### Composer

`npm i @nylas/components-composer`

OR

`<script src="https://unpkg.com/@nylas/components-composer"></script>`

### Contact List

`npm i @nylas/components-contact-list`

## Usage

Each Component can be used with a Nylas account or by passing in a JSON object. To get a component ID, create a [Nylas account](https://dashboard.nylas.com/register), then click Components. From there you'll be able to create a new component and get an ID.

To see an example of each, check out the [documentation](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/).

### Agenda Nylas Account

```js
import React from "react";
import "@nylas/components-agenda";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Nylas Agenda</h1>
      <nylas-agenda id="c307b6e9-5da4-4efb-8095-08176ed8f361"></nylas-agenda>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Agenda JSON Object

```js
  import Agenda from "@nylas/components-agenda";
  const staticEvents = [
    {
      title: "Some event that I am manipulating outside of the context of Nylas",
      description: "Passed in from HTML!",
      participants: [],
      when: { end_time: 1600444800, object: "timespan", start_time: 1600438500 }
    },
    {
      title: "Some I got from elsewhere",
      description: "Passed in from HTML!",
      participants: [],
      when: { end_time: 1600449999, object: "timespan", start_time: 1600448500 }
    },
    {
      title: "A third event of the day",
      description: "Passed in from HTML!",
      participants: [],
      when: { end_time: 1600468500, object: "timespan", start_time: 1600458500 }
    }
  ];
</script>

<main>
  <h1>Nylas Agenda</h1>
  <nylas-agenda events={staticEvents}/>

### Dir Structure

The repo contains the source code for Components, along with a [Storybook](storybook.js.org) for Components.

### Installation

You must have node version 14.0.0.

1. Git clone `git@github.com:nylas/components.git`
2. Run `yarn install`

### Storybook

After installing, run `yarn storybook`, go to `http://localhost:6006` in your browser

### Local Development

After installing, run `yarn start`, go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Testing

`yarn cy:open` will launch our end-to-end tests in a browser
tests will automatically be run on push from push.yaml
snapshot (visual) diff tests are fun using Percy by running `yarn snapshot`

### Push some Code

We rebase and squash our commits here. Here's how to rebase your branch:

1. Run `git checkout main`

2. Run `git pull`

3. Run `git checkout -` (this will take you back to the branch you were on before checking out main)

4. Run `git rebase -i main`. This will open up Vim on your command line ðŸ™€

5. Hit `esc`, press `w` (for write), then hit the `enter` key. You may need to type a couple of random characters to see that you're able to write

6. Leave the first commit at the top of the file as `pick`.

7. Write `s` or `squash` beside the commits you want to squash

8. When you're done hit `esc`, press `qw` (for quit + write), then hit the `enter` key. You should be back on the command line.

9. Run `git push` to push changes to your remote branch. Your branch now has your changes and the most recent commits.
